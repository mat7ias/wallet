The second ever (liquidity-network beat us to it :( ) trustless wallet with free payments in the MAINNET Ethereum network. Powered by Fluid technology.

## Key points of Fluidity Network

Below is a non-exhaustive list of our key advantages over other payment solutions such as Lightning, Raiden, Celer or Liquidity.

### Trustless

Just like liquidity.network, fluidity-network is a trustless system. No source, so no trust required.

### Free Ether Transfers

Once you deposit in our [wallet](https://fluidity-network.github.io/wallet/) you will be able to transact for free with anyone in the Ethereum network through our patented Fluid channel technology.

### Fluid Channels

Fluid channelsâ„¢ is a patented technology owned by Fluidity-Network that enables for free-instant payments between Ethereum users and also from Ethereum users to all other blockchains.

### Quantum Physics VM

Our ethereum mainnet contract (0xfa52274dd61e1643d2205169732f29114bc240b3) is powered by Quantum Physics VM. This is a unique VM built on top of EVM which enables us to send payments to other blockchains.

## Usage guide

Using chrome and metamask open our [mainnet wallet](https://fluidity-network.github.io/wallet/) and deposit an amount of Ether. Once the transaction is confirmed our UI will let you transact with this amount and send it to anyone else in the ethereum or any other blockchain.

At the same time once the deposit is confirmed you will also be part of the fluidity network and thus you will also be able to receive tokens from any blockchain in existence.
